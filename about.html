        <p> I am Ndey Sambou based at Bakoteh in The Gambia and I am 20. I am an undergraduate student at The University
          of The Gambia in Mathematics & Economics who loves computers and programming a lot. I always refused to
          believe the notion that only computer specialists can do programming. But, I believe with determination,
          commitment and hardwork, everyone can reach their dreams & goals.</p>
        <p> Through hardwork, confidence and dedication, I built valuable learning and working skills in programming at
          GOMINDZ. GOMINDZ is a Tech Industry in The Gambia that innovates New Thinking in the Tech World.....</p>
        <p> I have a lot of mentors in the Industry whom I always learn a lot from which has caused so many positive
          changes in me. I do a lot things at my freetime which makes me proud of myself.</p>
        <p> My passion is coding, software development and solving both technical and non-technical problems</p>
